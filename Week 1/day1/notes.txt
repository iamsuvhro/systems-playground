Execute command for the program:
gcc -Wall -Wextra -O0 -g hello.c -o hello

Explanation of this command:
-> gcc is use for convert your code into machine code.
-> -Wall is use for if code have any bugs it will throw warnings basically enable all warnings
-> -Wextra is for additional warnings
-> -O0 is for optimization level O (no optimization)
-> -g Allows GDB to show line numbers, variables, stack traces, etc. Without this, debugging is pain.
-> hello.c is the source filename.
-> -o hello is basically a output filename -o is flag.

Overall Summary:
It compiles hello.c into an executable named hello, with full warnings ON, no optimizations, and full debug information.

Command to inspect the binary
file hello
ldd hello
readelf -h hello

This builds awareness of:

file type
shared libraries
ELF header

Run under gdb for debugging:
gdb ./filename e.g. -> gdb ./hello
>> run
>> exit
