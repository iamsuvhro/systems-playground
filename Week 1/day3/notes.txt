Notes Day 3:
All the notes of day 3 focusing on Pointer.

Concept:

1. In C to check or get the address of a variable need to use '&' (e.g. &x)
2. To define a pointer in C need to use *p 

1. Defining (The "Badge")
int *p;
  - Meaning: "Create a variable named p that is allowed to hold addresses."
  - The Star: Tells the computer p is not a normal integer.

2. Linking (The "Connection")
p = &x;
  - Meaning: "Take the address of x and save it inside p."
  - The Star: NO STAR.
  - Why? Because p holds addresses. &x is an address. They match perfectly.

3. Using (The "Action")
Once you have linked them, if you want to actually change the value of 10 to 20 using the pointer, that is when you bring the star back.
*p = 20;
   - Meaning: "Travel to the address inside p, and change the value there to 20."
   - The Star: YES. The star acts as the "key" to open the door and touch the data.


Quick Notes:
1. Good practise is always assign NULL while declaring a pointer or else by default it will point some garbage.
2. Output specifier: %p -> address %x -> hexadecimal address %d -> integer.
3. Int is 4 bytes, Char is 1 byte, double is 8 bytes
4. pointer++ mean it will increase one size of type for example if int then +4size if char then +1 etc..
5. In array pointer when we initialize a pointer of that array then that pointer can increase by one step pointer++ 
   but array cant becuase it constant.
6. when I use * mean I am doing dereferencing that mean "follow the address to get to the actual data.".
7. In code i have implemented inbuilt functionalities of strlen, strrev


| Specifier | Meaning                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **%d**    | integer (int)                                     |
| **%u**    | unsigned int                                      |
| **%ld**   | long                                              |
| **%f**    | float                                             |
| **%lf**   | double                                            |
| **%c**    | char                                              |
| **%s**    | string (char*)                                    |
| **%p**    | pointer (memory address) — MUST cast to `(void*)` |
| **%x**    | integer in hexadecimal                            |
| **%zu**   | size_t (used with sizeof)                         |
