You Want,Standard C Code,Meaning
Read only,"""r""",Open existing file.
Write only,"""w""",Create new (or wipe existing).
Write + Read,"""w+""","Create new/Wipe, then allow both Read & Write."
Read + Write,"""r+""","Open existing, allow both (No wiping)."

There are two critical secrets about fgets that you need to know.

1. The "Minus One" Rule (The Safety Cap)
When you tell fgets the size is 255, it will actually only read 254 characters.
 - Why? Because C strings need a Null Terminator (\0) at the end to mark the finish line.
 - The Math: 254 characters from the file + 1 invisible \0 added by C = 255 bytes total.

2. The "New Line" Rule (The Early Stop)
fgets is designed to read Line by Line. If the line in your text file is just "Hello" (5 letters), 
fgets will read those 5 letters, see the "Enter" key (\n), and stop immediately. It won't try to fill the remaining 249 slots.
